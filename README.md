# 📊 SCT_DS_1 – World Population Data Analysis

This is Task 1 of the **SkillCraft Technology – Data Science Internship**.  
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a **World Population Dataset** to gain insights into global demographic trends using Python and data visualization libraries.
